## Git Commit Rules

- **ONLY commit files that you directly modified**
- Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`
- Always use specific file paths with `git add`
- Review `git status` before staging files
- Only stage and commit the exact files you worked on
- Never commit changes without user approval
- Always include the claude session id in git commits with format "Claude session id <session-id>"
